For a long time I wanted to have a personal site and blog. One day surfing on the Internet I found `Jekyll` and offers me everything that I need in a simple and easy way: static pages generator (html, js and css), blogging system (posts, categories, etc), generate content using Markdown, templates and layouts engine, GitHub Pages integration, customization and a lot of other interesting stuff. And it's written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, one of my favourite languages.

Especially, I would highlight the simplicity to deploy the site. In case of using GitHub Pages (more <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">information</a>) as the server: commit your changes, push it to your repository and that's it. If you are using any other hosting, just build the site (with a given task: `jekyll build`) and upload generated files to your server.

When you are in development mode, you can run the site (task: `jekyll serve`) locally. By default is served by WEBrick, a Ruby HTTP web server.

Another important point is the community behind the framework. Some people contribute directly to the core, other people implementing extensions via plugins. There is already a considerable <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">list of them</a>.

Check the full documentation in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> page.

Hello world!
