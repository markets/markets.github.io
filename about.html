<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Marc Anguera Insa (a.k.a. <a href="https://github.com/markets" target="_blank">@markets</a>), born in 1986. I'm living in Barcelona and I love to build things on the Internet. I'm a Lead Engineer and CTO of <a href="https://crisalix.com" target="_blank">Crisalix</a> and I co-founded <a href="https://desaigner.com" target="_blank">Desaigner</a>.</p>

<p>I have a degree in computer engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (<a href="https://www.upc.edu/" target="_blank">UPC</a>).</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working on the analysis, development and scalability of different types of web based applications. Especially using Ruby and some of its frameworks (like <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>) and Javascript. Check out more <a href="/projects">projects</a> I'm actually working on.</p>

<p>I like to participate in the different areas of a project (design, implementation, delivery, maintenance) and build robust and UX friendly applications, using agile methodologies. I always try to find pragmatic and simple solutions when solving problems. And follow good practices, both development and organization side. I'm also very interested in Team/Product management and architecture solutions. And everthing related to digital products in general.</p>
