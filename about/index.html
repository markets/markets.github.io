<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is <b>Marc Anguera Insa</b>, born in 1986. I spent the last years in Barcelona studying, developing and sharing good moments with a lot of people.</p>

<p>During these years I got the computer engineering career in Barcelona School of Informatics (<a href="http://www.fib.upc.edu/" target="_blank">FIB</a>) faculty belonging to Polytechnic University of Catalonia (<a href="http://www.upc.edu/">UPC</a>).</p>

<p>Currently I'm working on the analysis and development of web applications. Especially using Ruby and some of its frameworks (like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>) and Javascript.</p>

<p>I like to participate in the different areas of a project and build comfortable and friendly applications for the users and the internet. I always try to find pragmatic and simple solutions. And follow good practices, in both the development and in the organization side.</p>
