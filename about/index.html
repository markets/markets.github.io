<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Marc Anguera Insa</strong>, born in 1986. Also known as <strong>@markets</strong> on the Internet. I spent the last years in Barcelona studying, building projects and sharing good moments with a lot of people.</p>

<p>During these years I achieved the computer engineering career in Barcelona School of Informatics (<a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/" target="_blank">FIB</a>) faculty part of Polytechnic University of Catalonia (<a href="https://www.upc.edu/" target="_blank">UPC</a>).</p>

<p>Actually I'm working on the analysis and development of different types of web applications. Especially using Ruby and some of its frameworks (like <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>) and Javascript.</p>

<p>I like to participate in the different areas of a project and build comfortable and friendly applications for the users. I always try to find pragmatic and simple solutions. And follow good practices, both development and organization side.</p>
